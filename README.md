# CS-300
This repository contains my submissions to the CS-300 (Data Structures) course

---
## Homework 1:

Maze generation with 2D matrices, maze validation, maze traversal using stacks

---
## Homework 2:

AVL tree-based search engine for words (takes in several text files, processes them, and finds out how many times the query word occured in each file)

---
## Homework 3:

Same engine from homework 2, but it uses a BST, and also uses a Hash table, then given a qeury word it searches the word in both data structures, times the search operation and compares the speed.
